# RedTeaming
Public repository to post my scripts to aid with my cybersecurity studies. Currently studying for the OSCP.

# File descriptions:
ipaste_myip.txt - Contains two commands to aid with the handling of different machine's IPs:\
"**myip**" copies your own tun0 IP to your clipboard.\
"**ipaste *<IP>***" stores the <IP> value. "ipaste" copies the <IP> value to your clipboard.\
